What punishment is this, that I am to bare the keys to my own doom with no hope of salvation...These skulls sneer their devilish grins, voices chattering, tempting me to take the plunge deeper into Hell...I won’t do it.\r\n\nI’ve hidden them away amongst the furnishings, books, and the very foundations of this accursed place.

Каково же наказание, что я обнажаю ключи от своего собственного обречения, не имея надежды на искупление...Эти черепа ухмыляются дьявольскими улыбками, голоса перешёптываются, заманивая меня погрузиться глубже в Ад...Я не стану этого делать.\r\n\nЯ спрятал их среди мебели, книг, и в самом фундаменте этого проклятого места.
